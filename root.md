## The Text: The Sophist
## First part:
1. Model of classification
2. Acquiring multiple classifications <br>
of the sophist
3. Ergo: confusion --> need to inquire into <br>
this more.

## Section 232a-237a (6 p)
### Sophist as Expert in Belief-Knowledge:
1. If somebody(P) takes (S) to be expert <br>
at many things, <br>
then P does not clearly see what expertese <br>
makes S appear as knowing many things.<br>
2. Sophits engage in disputes.
3. In disputes about what?
4. Disputes about: god, earthly stuff, 'being and <br>
comming to be', law and politcs <br>
5. The shophist seems to know everything.
6. Can humans know everything?
7. No. 
8. Can S who does not know make a sound <br>
objection against P who knows?
9. No. 
10. Sophists contradict about many things
11. Would any S pay a Sophist if S would <br>
think that Sophist does not know?
12. No.
13. People pay to Sophists.
14. From 12 and 13 results that people <br>
thinkg that sophists know many thing.
15. From 6 and 14 results that Sophists <br>
have a kind of belief knwoledge about everyhting <br>
but not truth. 

### The Immitation Argument:

1. This belief-knowledge is like immitation.
2. Through immitation one can produce the appearance <br>
of the real thing. 
3. One can produce many appearances, while the real thing <br>
is harder to produce.
4. From 2 and 3 it results that one can have immitations <br> virtually about everything.
5. These immitations can fould people into believing <br>
they are the irl thing.
6. Such an immitator is like a magician.
7. applying the method of division <br>
for categorising the art of copy-making <br>

### Applying division for copy-making:
1. Copy-making:
2. likeness-making/appearance-making <br>
• likeness-making=immitation aiming at original properties <br>
• appearance-making=immitation making X similar <br>
to original but diff properties. In art propertions <br>
are manipulated to make it more beautiful.
3. Sophist seems like an appearance-making

### The Sophist and Non-Being:
1. appearance making = making x seem as x is not 
2. not being cannot exist (Parmenides)
3. The sophist does appearance-making 
4. From 3: the Sophist makes x seem as what is not.
5. From 4 and 2: contradiction. <br>
• The Sophist does something seemingly impossible. 

#### Starting of Analysis:
What the Sophist does seems impossible due <br>
to the following reasoning: 

1. Saying things, but not true things.
2. Seeming but not being
3. What form of speech is used for saying <br>
that there exist "false sayings or false believing" <br>
without contradiction.
4. Points 1 and 2 assume that "what is not is". <br>
• This is true since "otherwise falsity would not <br>
come into being" <br>
• This contradicts with Parmenides:
5. <q> Never shall this force itself on us, that that which is not may be ; <br>While you search, keep your thought far away from this path</q><br>
— *Parmenides* <br>

## Section 237b—254b 
### Analysis Proper

#### Speaking and  Being:
1.   "What should the name "that which is not" <br>
be applied too?
2. What is the purpouse of uttering (it) "that which <br> is not"?
3. What would be indicated by it to somebody else?
4. "that which is not" cannot be applied <br>
to "that which is" (*exclusive disjunction*)
5. Since it cannot be applied to "what is", <br>
it cannot be applied to something <br>
6. To apply to something means to apply to one thing.
    1. point 6 is about reference, any <br>
        obj has a numerical obj it refers to. <br>
        All that exsits is numerical, and <br>
        numerical does not apply to not-being.
6. Somebody who does not say something says <br>
nothing at all. 
7. Ergo: speaking always says something.
8. From 7, it results that one must reject <br>
the claim that S speaks but says nothing. <br>
— trying to utter "what is not" is not speaking.

#### That which is cannot belong to "what is not"
1. That which is can belong to others which <br>
are.
2. Numbers are beings.
3. Then, let's  apply "plurality/oneness" to <br>
"that which is not". 
4. It is wrong to apply plurality to not-being.
5. Plurality=Number=belongs to "what is" 
6. You cannot say without numbering
7. Ergo: u cannot speak about non-being. 
8. Even using the expression "that which is not" <br>
to talk about the non-utterabiltiy of it seems <br>
to treat nothingness as one. 

#### Even Making this arguments against non-being
1. If the nothing is unnaturable, then <br>
how can we make clames about it.!!!!
2. Calling any x means addressing it based on <br>
the form: one ("that which is not") <br>
— declarative sentences declare <br>
one specific thing. <br>
— numeration, one, implies being. <br>
— attaching "is" and "that" in "that <br>
which is not". 
3. Point 2 shows that the refutation till now <br>
is incomplete --> self-contradictory


#### On Likeness
1. will we succeed in this?
2. That 'which is like' is not really 'that which is'. 
    1. A copy=something which is made with the intention <br> to transfer the properties from the first <br>
    obj to the second object — to make the first <br>
    like the second. <br>
    2. 'that which is like'= something made as a <br> copy to something.          
2. That 'which is like' is not the true.
3. Not true means not geniune being. 
4. The likeness it geniunely is, but <br>
    it is as something ingeniune. 
    1. they claim that in such case <br>
        being and non-being are <br>
        interweaving. 
5. Likeness: something which is <br>
    but is not (as the original). 
6. This argument is intentionaly eliptical, <br>
    the sense in which "is not" is not mentioned. <br>
7. Ergo: likeness requires to accept non-being.
8. In the text it is as if <br>
    the Sophist argues that likeness, is, <br>
    but is not geniune, that it is at the <br>
    same time as it's not.

#### On Falsity. 
1. Appearance --> deception --> false beliefs.
2. A false belief = believing contrary to what is.
3. Contrary to what is:
    1. to say 'what is not' when 'it is'.
    2. to say 'what is' when 'it is not'. 
    3. he statement "that which is not" is" is <br>
    false. 
3. From 2 and 3: <br>a false belief = believing "that    which are not".
5. Ergo: falsity seems to against the *parmenidiean* <br>
*being vs non-being distinction*. <br>

### Deep Analysis of Parmenide's Claim: <br> What Does "x is" mean?
1. We either refute Parmenide or agree <br>
with the sophist.
2. Aim: to avoid contradiction when speaking about <br>
falsity. 
3. What does 'x is' mean?
4. What does 'x becomes x*' mean?
5. What does 'is not' mean?
6. Maybe we do not understand what 'x is' means.
7. Aim: Analysing 'being'. 
8. Is 'being' separated from 'the objects (which are)'?
9. If u say that multiple objects are 'being, then <br>
u say that the multiplicity is in fact a unity.
10. If one agrees to 9, then one agrees that <br>
calling an object as 'one' or as 'that object' <br>
instead of 'being' seems redundant since 'the object'<br>
is perfectly synonimous with being — there is unity, no <br> plurality. 
11. However, it is absurd to use the name 'the object' <br> if there is no account of it. 
12. Regarding 11, there are these options:
    1. If thing is different from name, then <br>
     he is mentioning two things.
    2. If thing is not different from name, then <br>
    name refers to nothing (cuz being is not the name).
    3. If thing is not different from name, then <br> 
    name the name is only a name of itself.

#### On Whole/Parts and Being: 
1. Parmenides affrims the whole is identical with being, <br> there exist no parts. 
2. If x has a middle and has extremities, <br>
then it must have parts.
3. However, each part has the characterisc of being one <br>, then "it's all being and also a whole".
4. This "characteristic of being one" cannot <br>
be the one itself.
5. The one itself has no parts.
6. Ergo, Either: 
    1. 'That which is' (it) is one and a whole
    2. 'That which is' is not a whole.
7. *Argument agains 6a:*
    1. If it has 'the charactersit of the one',  <br>
        this won't be the one (the whole) --> Everything is more <br> than one.
    2. If it is the whole itself, not as a characteristic of the one, <br> then it is less than itself. 
        1. In other words, by stating that x is <br>
        a whole not as a characteristic, <br> 
        you will state that x is one, even if, <br>
        in fact, x has parts, is not only 1. 
    3. Consequence of b:
        1. 'That which is' is deprived of itself. <br>
        Thus, 'that which is' is not.
    4. Conseqeuence of a:
        1. Everything will be more than one, <br>
         it and the whole will each have their distinct nature. 
    5. Ergo: 6a cannot be true for a Parmenidian <br>

11. *Argument ad absurdum, against 6b:*
    1. The whole must exist for any x to be:
        1. whatever becomes has at some point <br>
            become as a whole.
        2. that which is not a whole cannot have <br>
             quantitiy. 
        3. something that’s of a certain quantity  <br>
            has to be a whole of that quantity
8. **Final conclusion:**
    1. Confusion will arrive if we say that being <br>
    is either two or one. 
    2. the whole-part relationship opens problems <br>
    for a Parmenidic account. 

#### It is not easy to say: 'that which is' isn't. <br> Battle of the Giants: (246b)
1. two camps:
    1. Empiricists:
        1. Basics:
            1. draw things towards the earth.
            2. only what offers tangible contact is.
                 1. being=body
    2. Idealists:
        1. Basics:
            1. true being is not bodily forms that <br>
            can be thought about.
            2. they call what the empiricsts deam as <br>
            being as "becoming". Empiricists don't talk <br> about real being.
2. Argument I:
    1. part 1 (empiricists as starting p)
        1. They agree that there are mortal aniamls.
        2. They agree that such animals have a soul.
        3. The agree that souls exist.
        4. They agree that a soul can be just.
        5. A soul is contrary to soul by having <br>
            opposite atributs like just/unjust. 
        6. What can be present/absent from somebody <br> is a thing.
        7. From 6, justice is a thing. 
        8. They cannot say that justice is a <br>
            visible object. 
        9. Do invisible things have bodies?
        10. They say that soul has body, but <br>
            about justice and inteligence, they do <br>
            not affirm. 
        11. They need to determine what is <br>
            common between bodily and non-bodily <br>
            objects.
        12. *A thing exists iff it has a capacity*.    
            1.  capacity to do or be done upon.
    2. part 2: (idealists as starting p)
        1. They separate between 'comming to be' and <br> and 'being'.
        2. Through the body we deal with 'comming to be'.
        3. Through the soul we deal with 'being'
            1. Being = always the same.
        4. Becoming = changes
        5. They state that being cannot do something <br>
            upon anohter, or be done upon --> being cannot <br> be defined as a capacity.
        6. Do they agree that:
            1. the soul knows
            2. that being is known. 
        9. Are 'knowns' and 'being known' are cases <br>
            of doing or having something done? Both? <br> 
            Or netiher?
        10. If neither, to avoid contradition with <br> point 7, then intelligence is not part of being.
        11. It cannot be that being does not have  <br>inteligence.
        12. It cannot be that this being has 'inteligence' <br> and not be alive.
        13. If it has life, it cannot be changels
        13. Thus, change needs to belong to being. 
        14. Ergo: If no being changes, there cannot be <br> any being possesing intelligence. 
        15. If everything changes, then being cannot <br> remain in the same in the same respects.
        16. Yet, one cannot accept that being <br>
             changes in every way. The Philosopher <br>
             needs to have both 'becoming' and 'sameness'. 
3. Argument II:
    1. *Change* and *rest* are contraries
    2. Both are. 
    3. By stating point b, do you mean:
        1. both are at rest
        2. both change 
    4. The answer to point b is: neither of them.
    5. Based on d, is being a thrid thing, <br>
    different from rest and change. 
    6. Being cannot be such a third thing since: 
        1. If not changing, then resting.
        2. If not resting, how can it not change.
4. Conclusion:
    1. Both 'is' and 'not is' are in confusion.


### The philosopher
1. If some mix, and others don't mix, <br>
understanding how mixing works in a specific <br>
field defines an expertese.
2. Philosopher an expert in deciding  <br>
how to associate concepts umong each other. 
3. This dialectical activity can be attributible <br>
only to somebody with love for wisdom. 

## Section 254c-264c 

### Solving the issue with Being
### Association and that which is not:

#### On Association and Being:
1. should we apply being to both rest and change?
2. Obtions regarding association:
    1. Nothing can be associated 
        1. If association is impossible, rest <br>
        and change cannot be applied to being.
        2. Nothing can be said about being if no association.
    2. Everything can be associated
        1. then contraries would each be thier opposite <br> = impossible
    3. Only some can be associated. 
        1. the only option it seems.

#### On Association:
1. Classification of associationg:
    1. some things associate with each other
    2. some things do not associates (with each other)
    3. some (associate) to a small degree
    4. some to agreat degree
    5. some will associate to all others. 
3. Aim: analysis of form.
4. Method:
    1. will choose some of the most important <br>
    ones.
    2. will ask what they are like
    3. will ask about their ability to associate <br>
    with each other.
    4. see through the analysis if one can <br>
    say that 'that which is not' is.
5. Kinds to be discussed:
    1. 'that which is'
    2. rest
    3. change
6. On association and the kinds discussed:
    1. rest and change do not associate
    3. 'that which is' seems to associate <br>
        with both of them since both of them 'are'.
7. Each is different from the two of them, <br>
but is the same as itself.
8. Are *the same* and *different* part of these <br>
    three kinds, or are two other kinds?
    1. Change and rest are not identical with <br>  *'the different'* or *'the same'*. 
        1. if change or rest are either same or <br>
            different, then it will force the other <br>
            to change in its contrary. 
    2. Chage/rest are not *the same* and *the different*. 
    3. The same cannot be one with 'that which is' <br>
    since this would make change and rest identical. 
    4. Thus, the same is a forth besides the other forms. 
    5. What about difference?
        1. the different is alway said in relation <br>
        with each other.  
        2. the above  would not be true if *that which is* <br> and *the different* were not
            completely different.
            1.  "If the different shared in both kinds the way <br> that which is does, then some of the things <br> that are different would be different<br>  without being different in relation to <br> anything different"  (?)
    6. The differnt is also a fifth form. 
    7. All of them participate in the different <br>
    since each of them is differnt from the other. 
    8. Everything participates in the same since <br>
    every x is the same in relation to itself, but  <br>
    differnt in relation to something else. 
             
#### On difference and non-being
— any x is the same by being x. <br>
— any x is different from all else. <br>
— in one respect x participates in difference <br>
by being different from other things <br>
— however, x is diffrent from difference <br>
itself because x is x. <br>
— thus, the different at the same time is <br>
and is not. <br>
— what we call falsity, or 'not' being is <br>
not the contrary of 'that which is', but <br>
that which is diffrent from 'that which is'.<br>
— 'the not long' is not 'the short', but 'that <br>
which is equal' or 'that which is smal'l<br>
— i.e., is the other than 'the long'. <br>
Ergo, we succesfully explained 'that which <br>
is not. <br>
— due to associations, things are interconnected <br>
and each object is different from each other object <br>

### On Speech: does speech participate in non-being?
— speech is predication/declartive statement: <br>
— mode of nouns(names) and verbs. <br>
— S and P. <br>
— speech is saying soemthing about something <br>
— all speech has a quality. <br>
— the true =stating those that are as they are  <br>
— the false = stating x diffrerntly from that which
is.  <br>
— speech is about something <br>
— one can affirm about one both <br>
'*that which is* what it' is or '*that which* <br>
*differs* from that which is'. <br>
— since thought=speech, we should that the false <br>
can participate in the soul. <br>
— appearance = blending of perception and belief.
