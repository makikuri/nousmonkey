### On Non-Being:
1. argument on non-being
1. on images
2. on falsehood
    1. paradox on falsehood

### On Being:


### Civvelli and How Being is Used in Plato:
in what way the verb "to be" <br>
is used. <br>
— analytic tradition<br>
1. differnt meanings of being:
    1. being=exists
    2. being=predicative use:
        1. use "is" in the coupla to link <br>
        Subject with Predicate. 
        2. In Plato's greek you do not <br>
        always express the predicat.
        3. Non-being could be understood <br>
        as an object without predicate <br>
        =without attrivutes. 
        4. u can predicate a quality or <br>
        identity predication, predicating <br>
        the identity of the object, the <br>
        definition. 
    3. being=truth(veridical)

## Lecture 5:

### Problems on Being:
1. conversation with dualists
2. conversations with monists
3. (conversation with pluralists)
3. battle of giats

#### Prosopopoeia
1. Prosopopoeia = impersonating another. 
1. The persons in the dialogue are impersonating, 
   people who are absent, talking about the view of <br> absent people — why are often these people absent <br>
    1. Mary Louise Gill states that they are absent <br>
        because they cannot riguroulsy present their views.

#### On Dualists:
1. they separate the world in two types of entities
    1. collective duality
    2. distributive duality = each of them
    3. Since both opposites exist, then <be>
       Being is both = really not too
    4. One can argue that being over and both<be>
        the dualisms, there are three entities <be>
        in this ontology

#### On the Monists:
1. monist = everything is one. 
    1. the whole is one = monists
2. Key concepts
    1. the All
    2. Being
    3. the Whole
3. All things are one = monist 
    1. good reason to think that the views discussed <br>
         here are those of parmenides.
    2. Is it about Paremenides or the monists in <br>
        general? Contraversial point
4. Visitor: Do you say, monists, that all things are one?
    1. Monists: yes.
    2. Visitor: Do you say that all things are being?
    3. Monists: yes.
    4. Are they two names "being"/"one" for the same 
       thing? <br>
    5. Vistor: even saying that they are two names <br>
       of 1 thing is porblematic: 
        1. if you admit that the  name refers to something <br> outside of itself --> not monism.
        2. If try to avoid the point above, then:
            1. either forced to say the name of nothing.
            2. or that the name is a name of itself, <br>
               which is a name of a name and nothing else. 
    6. Applying this to the names:
        1. "being the name of the one is being the one of the name"
    7. Parmenides says that being is a sphere:
        1. they say that being is a whole
        2. If x has a middle and extremeties, (how  <br>
        Parmeendies constitutes the whole has parts)
        3. Being has a unity as a pathos, as an affection <br> because it itself participates <br> in such a whole. 
        4. The one being unites as one cannot be <br>
           the same as the one doing the unification. 
        5. The one is above being, being has unity as a whole only because it participates in the one <br> *Neo-plantonists liked this passage
        6. Consequences of above:
            1.  If the one is a unity, then everything is <br> more than the one:
                1. If we say that there is one, bieng, and <br> whole, we already have more than one. 
            2. If everything is one, then the whole is <br> less than itself:
                1. The whole, the one, the whole is differet from that which is, then, that which is is less than itself
                2. being is deprived of itself
                3. if it has holeness as something added <br>
                 added to it, then it has less than <br>
                 it should be: it should be wholeness <br>
                 itself. 
                4. this view does not have a lot of <br> textual support. 
                5. The better interpretation is:
                    1. There are two types of wholeness:
                      1. wholeness made out of parts
                      2. wholeness without parts
                      3. Parmenide's wholeness is not <br> one without parts
                       3. Thus, Paremenide's wholeness <br> is less than what wholeness <br>  geniunely is. 
              6. Thus, the monist view states that <br>
                 being is less than itself, what is <br>
                 called "being by the monist" is not <br>
                 being itself. 

#### On Becoming
1. Multititudes
2. There is no whole
3. Through becoming, we hope, that a <br>
    whole  will emerge
6. However, this is impossible. Since:
    1. It would not become a being since a being<br>
       would then be that which has achieved that <br>
       wholeness.
    2. Previous point is true since everything <br>
       that becomes "becomes as a whole"
        1. To become something = becoming a whole
    3. Something cannot be a quantity without <br>
        being a whole. 

### Battle of the Giants:
1. Battle between:
    1. People who believe that being is:
        1. only what they can touch (born from the earth)
    2. People who believe that being is:
        2. being is only what can be grasped by the mind
         1. = immaterial
2. One needs to make a compromise, choosing between <br>
   the two is not the best. 
   1. By compromise it is meant that one camp <br>
      allows the other to exist:
      1. compromise with empiricists:
            1. let them allow for non-corporeal x to exist
            2. Everything that is able to be affected, to do 
           <br> something = being. 
            3. dynamos = being = power as undergoing or to do.
      2. compromise with rationalists:
            1. if you take dynamos, then you have to <br>
                accept that there is more than stable/ <br> changeless forms

#### Compromise of the Giants:
1. Compromise of the Empiricist:
    1. The accept that there are mortal animals
    2. These mortal animals have a soul
    3. They say that souls can be just/inteligent etc
    4. Is a souls  just by:
        1. having justice? 
        2. Justice beeing present in them 
    5. They say that the soul is a body
    6. They would not say that justice <br>
       is a body (ashamed to expressed what they think)
    7. Thye need to admit of 1 bodilyess being
        1. then they need to say that there <br>
           are both bodily and non bodily beings.
        2. and say what is common between them
        3. bodily = visible, for Giats
        4. if thet say that justive is bodily <br>
           and invisible = enough for the argument
    8. compromise reached

#### Compromise of "The Friends of The Forms":
1. One can distinguish between:
    1. "becoming"
    2. "being" 
2.  we have access to both bodies and non bodies
    1. to both "beocming" and "being"
    2. access = iconomia = sometijng in common 
        1. dealing with. 
3. Does this "dealing with" mean dynamis, <br>
    this power in two ways:
    1. to undergo
    2. to do


1. Friends of the form reject this modal <br>
   characterisation of being
   1. they reject it because they do not want <br>
       "becoming" to participate in "being"
    2. they see being as something complety stable
        1. without change, interelations
2. Different intereprtation of dunamous:
    1. to know is to do, to be known is to be affected
    2. to know/to be known is to affect and to be affected
    3. to know is to be affected/to be known is to affect
    4. to know and be known are neither to affect or be affected.
        1. friends of the form would go with 4, <br>
            since it allowes them to keep their position.
3. This new criterion for being is not mentioned <br>
    ever again in the text.
4. One must accept, accoridng to Plato, needs to <br>
   accept that being must be characterised in <br>
   terms of activity, life, thinking, and being <br>
   thought of, and all these characteristics imply <br>
   this criterion of being (dunamous) 
    1. thus, one needs to accept one of the 3 <br>
       interpretations of dunamous. 
       1. Plato views relations as properties <br>
            1. thus, relations imply change <br>
            2. that an object is known <br>
            3. it meaning a minimal kind of change <br>
            4. the property of being known by x <br>
5. Plato affirms that we need life and intelect <br>
   and that being needs both change and rest.
   1. rest makes being stable     

#### Extra:
#### Ontological criteria (247e):
(modal characterisation of being)
1.  X has being iff (247d):
    1. it can do something
    2. it can have something done upon it.
2. what does this mean?
    1. different interpretations
        1. something to undergo something by <br> 
           something else = it has something else <br>
           as a property = to undergo x = to have x <br>
           as property  (it is very weak, Giants think <br> more of bodily interactions)
        2. x to undergo y by z means z has causal power <br> on x. 



#### Who are the Friends of The Froms
1. people think that these "friends of the forms" <br>  are the previous Plato of the middle period
    1. the new Plato = opened towards interplay <br>
           between forms. 
    2. unlikelt interpretation since <br>
       Plato would never utterlt reject Heraclitus
       1. he icorporates from him
       2. and he rejects Heraclitus's view
 2. Others say that they are the Eleatics
    1. Eleatics = the parmenideans 
3. Or they are the Pythagorean.
4. Or that they are another school.
5. Or that they are fictional entities <br>
        representing those who misunderstand <br>
        Plato. 


## Lecture 6:

### Answering to Questions II
1. Plato probably commits here to the idea that <br>
    kinds are stable = implication of how he discusses <br> we need stability cuz otherwise we could not <br> have kinds. 
    1. the dialogue can be viewed as addressing <br>
       also those who do not beleive in kinds as forms <br> = who are more deflationary
    2. there needs to be something common to all <br>
        red obj = stability in kind requiered for <br>
        science and meaningful conversations.
    
1. is he taking about the kind change/rest, <br>
   or about changing/resting things. <br>
    1. Both, one is tempted to view it in terms <br>
        of Plato's metaphysics of Forms. 
2. Some things are changing and some things <br>
   are at rest, some are always at rest, some <br>
   are always changing = for Plato

### Start of Today's reading: 

#### Difficulty With Change=Stabilty both happening:
1. radical Heracliteanism = everything changes always and at <br>
   the same time 
    1. If no stabiltiy over change, then one cannot talk about <br>
       change in a conceptually meaninfdul way

##### Confusion, Apoira:
1. Confusion, aporia, also rises here.
2. Those who think of being have the same <br>
    propblems as those thinking of non-being. 
3. Being is different from change and rest = being <br>
   does not change or rest. 
4. Starts a discussion about dualism (paper topic to comp <br>
both discusions of dualists)

##### Change and Rest are opposites:
1. Change and rest together are
2. Change is
3. Rest is
4. Kinds/things can change 
    1. (their characteristics can change)
    2. One can view it PLatonical way:
        1. That the kind change participates <br>
           in the kind rest. 
5. Change and rest cannot blend
    1. In some sense one can say that they blend.
    2. They are related.
    3. One can ask why do they accept "5" so fast.
6. Change is = change is identical with being?
    1. if u say that stability is = bieng
    2. Then, one can say that Change = rest, <br>
       and one can get into trouble.
    3. Thus, being is different from rest and change
7. Thus, being is a third.
    1. Change + rest = Being,
    2. one can divide being in change and rest
    3. However, if being is different <br>
        from rest/change, then it is not <br>
        resting or changing. 
    4. Something seems wrong in thus argument, <br>
        according to Plato.
        1. It is strange to say that being itswld <br>
           does not change or rest
8. Different interpretation of "Being as a third:
    1. Statements:
        1. Being ≠ Change + rest
        2. Being ≠ change
        3. Being ≠ rest
        4. C: Being does not have rest
    5. Interpretations of 1-3:
        1. **negative identity statement**
            1. These mean that the kind Being is <br>
               not identical with these other kinds.
        2. **negative predication statement**
            1. These mean that being is not an  <br> instantiation
                of change or of rest, both  <br> together and separetely.
    6. Interpretation C:
        1. **negative identity statement**
        2. **negative predication statement**
    7. The falacy appears when one views:
        1. 1-3 as negative identity and C <br>
        as negative predication.
    8. One can say that here is no fallacy:
        1. "Being neither rests/changes by its own nature"
        2. This is not a case of ordinary predication
        3. The phrase:  "by its own nature" is indicative <br>
           that being in C means **identity** (not preidcation)
        4. Maybe it is a special kind of predication here, <br>
           maybe this is what "by its own nature' means. 
        4. look on handout for more, confusing part
9. Blending oposite kinds = contradiction (be careful how <br>
    u define things)
10. Problem of being and non-being are interrelated:
    1. By understanding being, one understands non being
        1. optimist
        2. People have discussed being more than non-being.
    2. For understanding being, one needs to understand <br> non-being
        1. Pesimist

##### Late Learner's views:
1. How can we apply names at all
2. There are 2 problems with late learners:
3. talking about kinds not neccesarily equally <br>
   with universal. 
4. Late learners play on the confusion between <br>
   statements of identity and statements of <br>
   predication.
    1. if u thing that when you say is you express <br>
       identity then you obviously think that you can <br>
       say only man is man and grass is grass.
5. Look more on handout for this
   
### Positive Part of the Text:
1. on Blending:
2. Some kinds blend and others do not blend
    1. The option selected by Plato
    2. Some letters combine and others do not
    3. Being is combinably with everything
    4. Difference is combinable with both change <br>
       and rest. 
    5. Sameness is applicable in all cases if you make <br>
       tautological sentences. 

3. See text notes for more
4. No kinds blend is wrong = cuz they need at <br>
   least to blend with being. 

#### Dialectics:
1. Has diff def in different Platonic dialogues
2. dialectics = abstract thinking on linguistic <br>
   and logic
3. In aristotle, dialectics means something much lower:
    1. gathering opinions about things from <br>
       knowable man.
4. The dialectician is the philospher.
