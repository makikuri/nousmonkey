#### My own Critique of Plato (extra)
— to believe a falsity x means to believe that -x <br>
is true = to believe that (-x)"what is not" is. <br>
— (?) here i tend to disagree cuz compositionality, <br>
see formal theories of language notes. <br>
— "-x" refers to a state of affairs composed of real objects, <br> even if these objects are not the case.<br>
— faslity =intension without extension. <br>
— Since the intension belongs to being, the above <br> seems as a flase problem. <br>
— one can affirm that still, the extensional refering <br> act is an act of 'refering to an empty set' and <br>
that 'refering to an empty set'=refering to 'what is not'<br>
—One can disagree with view on extension, stating that <br> extensions with empty sets do not refer to 'non <br>
being states of affairs', but that they simply do not <br> match with any being. <br>
— "not" as mismatch, not as extentional reference. 
10. It seems verry hard to achieve our goal <br>
since falisity itself is embedded in this confusion. <br>
