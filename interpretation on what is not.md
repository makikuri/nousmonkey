## Cliveli's interpretationns:<br>
1. The ontological interpretation.<br>
    a. To posit "the false" = "what is not is" <br>
       = contradiction. <br>
2. The semantic-gnoseological interpretation.<br>
    a. saying or thinking what is not = impossible <br>
       = one cannot say anything about the false. <br>
    1. The indefinability interpretation.<br>
        a. To define falsehood, one must speak of what is not <br>
              = impossible <br>
    2. The inexistence interpretation <br>
         2.1 Interpretation of propositions <br>
         a. a sentence to express what is not <br>
            = not expressing a proposition = is not a sentence <br>
         4.2. Collapse of truth conditions on meaning conditions <br>
         a. sentence = meaningfull = refers to reality <br>
          --> what is false = meaningless<br>
<p>

1. This truth-entailing porting of <br>
reality could fall under different categories: <br>
    1. a fact – the fact that Theaetetus is flying <br>
    2.  a trope – Theatetus' flight <br>
    3. a predicative complex – flying-Theaetetus <br>
